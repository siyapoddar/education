                Womens education is critical to the countrys entire development. Its similar to an effective medicine that may know how to cure a patient and recover their health. A well-educated lady is capable of managing both her personal and professional lives. The physical and intellectual growth of the child is the moral goal of education. Educations true objective is to provide students with “full knowledge” or “greater information.” 

A well-educated woman provides the skills, knowledge, and self-assurance necessary to be a better mom, worker, and citizen. A well-educated woman will also be more productive and well-paid at work. Indeed, the return on investment in education is often higher for women than for males.

                            Every society has communities, factions, or groups that are denied or repressed of their basic rights, but there is a common binding factor in these elements that can be termed as the lack of awareness about their rights either among them or some of the ‘dominant’ members of said society.


However, women have been primary targets of this denial of basic rights in the majority of societies for a large part of the history of mankind. Whether it is the right to life and liberty or freedom of opinion and expression or the right to work and education, women have been on the ‘further’ end of this spectrum.

                          </p>Reasons Why Education is So Important for Women/Girls
                          1) Better Standard of Living
                          
                          Better standard of living for the family is one of the advantages of women/female education. It doest take a mathematician to conclude that a family relying on double wages is more content and happy than a family which relies on the income of a single parent.
                          
                          An educated mother will earn as good as the father of the family and will look after the financial needs of her family in a much better way. Two incomes under the same roof will improve the quality of living and also ensure better education and facilities to the children, not to mention that a happy family will ultimately lead to a happy society.
                          
                          2) Improved Health and Hygiene
                          
                          Women are more concerned about the health of their family than men and have a great sense of hygiene too. Even working women are constantly concerned about their familys health and dont compromise with it at any cost.
                          
                          It is only because of the women in the house that men work free, with the only responsibility of earning money; as they know that everything else in the house is being take care of. So it becomes imperative that the women who is taking care of the family and your children is educated, so that she recognizes the health hazards and is confident enough to act prudently to eliminate them.
                          
                          3) Dignity and Honor
                          
                          A woman is the dignity of a house, and a society is judged depending on how its women are treated and how much they are educated. It is only when a woman is able to protect her own dignity and honor, that she will be able to protect the dignity and honor of her family. An uneducated woman may lack the courage to speak for her own dignity while an educated woman will be confident enough to fight for it.
                          
                          4) Self Reliance
                          
                          Education makes a woman self reliant; that is, she does not depend on anyone for her own survival as well as the survival of her children. She knows that she is educated and could well be employed equally like men and fend for the needs of her family. A woman, who is financially independent, can raise her voice against injustice and exploitation.
                          
                          5) Eliminating Crime against Women
                          
                          Many of the social evils and crimes against women can be easily eliminated by educating women. Incidents of dowry, flesh trade, female infanticide as well as harmful customary practices can be eradicated by educating women of a society. An educated woman plays a very important role in a civilized family and influences the thoughts and beliefs of its members.
                          
                          She is unlikely to remain silent on domestic violence against other woman or girl in the family; and will definitely help in strengthening the social fabric of the society. An educated woman will never concede to the female infanticide and is well aware that it is a crime as per the law and also forbidden by any religion.
                          
                          
                          
                          Educating women will also lead them to become political leaders, who can fight for the rights and justice of other women. Women political leaders or bureaucrats can more effectively
